# ATXAffordability

This site was created to fulfill the requirements for my Practicum in GIS Development course at UW-Madison. The objective was to create an interactive web map allowing users to explore the issues surrounding housing affordability in Austin, TX. The web map displays median home costs, racial distribution, undeveloped lots of land, Kirwan Opportunity Index data, and current affordable housing sites. This project utilized Leaflet, a Mapbox tileset, and CARTO databases to store the data.
